# Calculator Exercise

> Implementation of the calculator exercise

## Requirements

1. Create an `add`, `subtract`, `multiply` and `divide` functions using the arrow syntax
    ```js
      const greet = () => `Hello, World!`
    ````
2. Make sure each operation works (extra credit for attempting to use a testing framework)
3. Create an obect named `calculator`, and group all the functions in this object.
4. Observe the different in syntax versus the anonymous/arrow function syntax

## Installation

Clone and install dependencies using npm/yarn by using the following commands:

```bash
npm install
yarn
```

### Run the tests

Make sure all the test pass by running `npm test` or `yarn test`

### Compare Results

There are numerous ways to complete all the assignments (usually).  This is my perspective on the problem at hand.
